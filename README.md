Syntactic Tree Extraction and Merging Platform

The goal of this project is to use the publicly available github repos, and create a consolidate, translate and merge source code across languages.  By using native and common syntax languages will be translated in to XML in order to utilize xslt sheets to extract and merge functions.

Use case:
I have a library written in Java and C# and I want code automatically convert and consilidate from both libaries in to a single C# or Java library, while reducing common code elements.

Though libaries across software language platforms are not created equal, for now the project will be restricted to syntax merges assuming framework libraries exist in both.  For most developers such consolidation techniques should be a great time saver.

The long term goal is to have Cartesian Genetic Programming algorithms guide the merging across languages.
